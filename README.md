Ow! Pain Tracking Privacy Policy
Ow! Privacy Policy
Information We Collect
Ow! does not collect, store, or share any personal information such as your IP address, device identifiers, or other data that can identify you—except for optional in-app features that require user input. The app may collect aggregated usage data (e.g., how often “Ow” entries are logged or which days are most active) to improve app functionality and user experience. This data is anonymized and not linked to any individual user.
Optional Data Collection
If you choose to subscribe for unlimited entries or use optional features, certain information may be collected to support these features:
Username or display name (for subscription account or leaderboard display)
Entry data (number of “Ows,” timestamps, or details you provide)
This information is stored securely and used only for the purpose of displaying rankings, managing subscriptions, or improving app functionality. It is never sold or shared outside of what is necessary for the feature.
Use of Third-Party Services
Some features of Ow! may utilize third-party services (e.g., StoreKit for in-app purchases, analytics, or cloud services). These services may collect anonymized or aggregated data as part of their operations. Ow! does not share personally identifiable information with these third parties. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of any third-party services used.
How We Use Your Information
Aggregated usage data: To improve app functionality, charts, and user experience.
Subscription or optional feature data: To verify access, award benefits, and display relevant content.
No other personal information is processed or shared.
Data Retention
Aggregated usage data is stored in anonymized form and retained only for app improvement purposes.
Subscription or optional feature data is retained only as long as necessary to provide the service or comply with legal obligations.
Children’s Privacy
Ow! is intended for users aged 13 and up. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Users under 18 should obtain parental consent before using features like leaderboards, subscriptions, or optional data-enabled features.
Your Choices and Controls
You can disable permissions (e.g., Game Center or analytics access) in your device settings.
You may request deletion of subscription or optional feature data by contacting us at: FreeFlyMaps@gmail.com
Security
We maintain best practices to secure aggregated usage data and optional feature data, including encryption and restricted access.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this policy to reflect changes in app features, data handling, or legal requirements. Updates will be posted here with a new “Last Updated” date.
